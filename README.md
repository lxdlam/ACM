# Ramen's Competitive Programming Answers

There are Ramen's competitive programming answers.

I'm a former ICPC participant and now just an enthusiast of competitive programming.

I'm using C++11 and later to solve problems in major. I recommend you to use the latest compilers because some C++14/17 features are also involved in some sources. For python users, I solve problems using python 3, and python 2 may not work.

This repository is for my own progress tracking. If you're looking for some algorithm templates, `My Templates` folder may contain something useful for you. If you're looking for some tips for interview problems or algorithm tutorials, I believe there are many better materials over the internet, for instance, Codeforces always offer awesome lectures and problems to practice, there are also many great video tutorials on YouTube.

For any optimization suggestions or mistakes in my templates, fire an issue so I can fix them. If you want to contribute, feel free to make a pull request.

Keep coding, keep going.
