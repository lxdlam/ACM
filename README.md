# Ramen's ACM-ICPC Answers

There are Ramen's ACM-ICPC problem answers.

All of the codes here are AC codes, but many of them can be optimized. Some of them are just partial solutions.

Many of them are written under C++14 standard.
You can compile them using:
- Clang 4.0
- GCC 6.3.0

Also, there are some Python3 and Haskell source files, you can run them using Python 3.6.0 and GHC 8.1.2.

If you have a question, just open an issue.

Hope these codes will help you.

Keep coding, keep going.
