# Ramen's ACM-ICPC Answers

There are Ramen's ACM-ICPC problem answers.

All of the codes here are AC codes, but many of them can be optimized. Some of them are just partial solutions.

Many of them are written under C++14 standard. I compile them using:
- Clang 5.0
- GCC 6.3.0

You can use any compilers which supports C++14 standard well to compile them. You may need to make your own change to suit C++03 or C++11 standard.

Also, there are some Python3 and Haskell source files, you can run them using Python 3.6.0 and GHC 8.1.2.

If you have any question, feel free to open an issue.

Hope these codes will help you.

Keep coding, keep going.
